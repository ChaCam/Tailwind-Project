                  Views on American imperialism were differentiated into two
                  categories, for and against imperialism. Many places, even
                  some that were not contiguous to the United States, almost
                  became annexed. One such place was the Dominican Republic.
                  President Grant believed in the annexation of the Dominican
                  Republic, as seen through his proposed annexation of the
                  state. This treaty proposed by Grant would not get past the
                  Senate. One of the main opposing senators was Charles Sumner,
                  who opposed the annexation as he claimed that it would become
                  a violent and bloody state. This reason can be further
                  supported by the fact that the government was not stable and
                  people overthrew the country many times. In addition, due to
                  the close proximity to the country of Haiti, people did not
                  want to absorb the influence of the state. Most senators just
                  wanted to keep the country by itself because of these reasons.
                  The Dominican Republic was not the only state that was
                  attempted to be annexed.

                  The Hawaiian islands would eventually be annexed by President
                  William McKinley. However, before McKinley annexed it, the
                  bill to annex the state was vetoed by the president at the
                  time, Grover Cleveland. Cleveland believed that Hawaii was
                  overthrown in an unfair way and he wanted to give them the
                  same freedom that America had. Not only did he veto the
                  annexation, but he also tried to restore the queen back to
                  power. This anti-imperialistic nature of Cleveland would lead
                  to the election of William McKinley who had opposing ideas of
                  Cleveland. He heavily supported annexation, which is seen
                  through the outcome of the Spanish-American War. He would, of
                  course, annex the new Hawaiian islands. In addition, he would
                  purchase the islands of the Philippines, Guam, and Puerto
                  Rico. Some of these are even still part of the United States
                  today.

                  Foreign policy also had a huge effect in the Spanish-American
                  War. The president at this time was President McKinley, who
                  was strongly in support of imperialism. He believed that Cuba
                  should be independent from the Spanish, and that the United
                  States owed protection to the territory. Also, he believed
                  that the Philippines should become independent as well since
                  they were being mistreated by Spain. Another cause of this war
                  was the sinking of the United States' battleship, U.S.S.
                  Maine, in Havana's harbor. Even though the ship exploded
                  through an unknown means, the United States still believed
                  that it was Spain who did it.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                  The war started after the United States deployed troops in
                  Cuba. One of the main events of the war was the Battle of San
                  Juan Heights, which the United States won. Another main battle
                  was the Battle of Santiago de Cuba, which the United States
                  also won. This led to the surrender at Santiago, Cuba. Spain
                  officially signed the Treaty of Paris with the United States,
                  ceding some of its territories. The outcome of this war led to
                  the United States' acquisitions of many territories across the
                  globe. These territories include Cuba, as discussed above,
                  Puerto Rico, the Philippines, and the Sandwich Islands also
                  known as Hawaii. McKinley wanted to keep these territories as
                  part of the United States. He specifically said that he did
                  not want to give the Philippines back to Spain because it
                  would be dishonorable, give them to France or Germany because
                  they were the United States' economic rivals, or leave them as
                  an independent nation because they were not fit to govern
                  themselves. Eventually though, the United States would lose
                  two out of the four territories, which were Cuba and the
                  Philippines. The Philippines is specifically important because
                  it continues the theme throughout history of imperialism
                  causing war.

                  American imperialistic ideas can be seen through the
                  philosophies of Big Stick Diplomacy by Teddy Roosevelt and
                  Dollar Diplomacy by William Howard Taft. The Big Stick
                  Diplomacy can be best described as negotiating with the threat
                  of a powerful military. It was partially influenced by the
                  Monroe Doctrine to keep power centralized in the Americas.
                  Roosevelt was like an international policeman between North
                  and South America. This idea is used through the establishment
                  of the Panama Canal. Roosevelt wanted this canal to be built
                  to facilitate trade easily without having to go through the
                  route around South America. Before it was built though, the
                  United States led by Roosevelt recognized Panama as an
                  official country after it had declared independence from
                  Columbia. The president after Roosevelt, William Howard Taft,
                  believed in a different policy called Dollar Diplomacy. Rather
                  than Big Stick Diplomacy, it did not use strong military
                  power, but instead used economic power and gave loans to
                  foreign countries. Better relations wanted to be achieved with
                  these countries, including Mexico, Nicaragua, and China.

                  There were also the Philippine islands that America had gained
                  from the outcome of the Spanish-American War. American
                  occupation of this territory did not last long, as the
                  Philippine-American War occurred right after. The president at
                  this time was William McKinley, who wanted to keep control of
                  the new territories and believed in the idea of "The White
                  Man's Burden" and wanted to assimilate the people of the
                  islands. The American treatment of the Filippinos was not
                  great to say the least. An example of the unethical treatment
                  against these Filippinos can be seen through water cure where
                  American soldiers would torture them by forcing them to drink
                  a large amount of water. The territory would go on to last
                  around thirty years until World War II.

                <p>
                  President Woodrow Wilson strongly believed in an idea called
                  Moral Diplomacy. This idea meant that the United States
                  supported other nations that had similar governments to their
                  own. It helped the country pursue its economic interests
                  throughout the world. It would eventually lead to the
                  country's involvement in the Great War, later called World War
                  I. This is evident through the fact that exports of the United
                  States to the countries of Great Britain and France increased
                  during World War I, and its exports to Germany increased after
                  the war was over.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                  The United States' involvement in World War I was caused by
                  many reasons. One of the main reasons was the Zimmerman
                  Telegram. The message of this telegram stated that Germany
                  shall form an alliance in Mexico if it entered war with
                  Germany against the United States. President Wilson called for
                  war in his message to Congress. His main reason that is stated
                  in the message is that Germany kept attacking United States
                  ships with their submarines in the Mediterranean. The main
                  goal of the United States when joining the war was because of
                  Wilson's strong belief in Moral Diplomacy. This meant that he
                  and the country supported the Allies which included Britain
                  and France, both countries with democratic governments. On the
                  other hand, he and the Allies went against and did not support
                  the Central Powers, including countries with monarchies such
                  as Germany and the Ottoman Empire. Its role in World War I
                  helped the Allies gain victory over the Central Powers. First
                  of all, it helped by supplying the Allies with over a million
                  troops. After all, the war was won by overpowering by force
                  against the Central Powers. Another way they helped contribute
                  to the war was creating a blockade on the German coast,
                  heavily damaging their economy.

                  World War I impacted American society in multiple ways. One
                  way is that it increased the empowerment of women in society.
                  Since the men were out fighting in war, women took over some
                  of the traditional jobs of men as workers. These jobs included
                  radio operators, messengers, and truck drivers. Some women
                  even helped with the war effort, with many joining the Navy.
                  However, there were also negative effects of the war on
                  society. The war caused a very controversial law to be passed
                  by Congress, called the Sedition Act of 1918. This act
                  basically said that citizens could not express their opinions
                  of the government in a negative way, or else punishment would
                  occur. The law would eventually be repealed in 1920 because it
                  violated the first amendment. There was also the Great
                  Migration which was the period where millions of African
                  Americans, some of which were poor and looking for better
                  opportunities.

                  Another way World War I impacted American society was that it
                  affected the economy of the United States, both positively and
                  negatively. First of all, they used around thirty billion
                  dollars to fund the war. This came from a variety of ways
                  including taxes. The war would lead to a debt that would last
                  for years. Again, there were also positive economic effects.
                  The war helped facilitate trade between nations, specifically
                  with the Allies. Later, the United States would also trade
                  with former Central Powers such as Germany. The end of the war
                  would also have a huge economical effect throughout the whole
                  world. It made the United States a leading industrial power,
                  as they could easily mass produce new goods efficiently. Some
                  of these goods included automobiles, petroleum, and steel. In
                  addition to being a leading producer, they also provided money
                  to other countries who needed it.

                <p>
                  Before the Treaty of Versailles, President Woodrow Wilson
                  released his Fourteen Points. These points included the
                  freedom of the seas, peace, and adjustment of many colonial
                  claims. The Treaty of Versailles used some of these points and
                  was signed in 1919. The treaty was formally signed between
                  Germany and the Allied Powers. With this treaty, Germany was
                  at a loss in many things. Its many colonies in Africa and Asia
                  were gone, its military was reduced, it had to pay war
                  reparations to the Allies which would lead to their debt, and
                  of course it formally accepted defeat.

                <br />

                  After the war ended, there were efforts to establish the
                  League of Nations. It was heavily pushed by the president at
                  the time, Woodrow Wilson. The League would help unite the
                  countries such as Belgium, France, England, and Italy. The
                  United States also did not want every country to join, such as
                  Germany and Russia because of Wilson's idea of moral diplomacy
                  since they had different forms of government. The league would
                  not be able to stay together without the support of the United
                  States. However, not all people of the United States supported
                  the establishment of this league. One such person was Henry
                  Cabot Lodge, a Senator at the time who had opposing ideals to
                  Wilson. He claimed that the United States should not get into
                  the issues of the other countries in Europe. In addition, he
                  did not want to fight for or against other countries. These
                  would be the main ideas of the establishment of the League of
                  Nations. Even though the United States heavily advocated the
                  league, they never joined. This is one of the many reasons
                  that the League of Nations was a failure, as it was replaced
                  with the United Nations in the next twenty-five years.
